Task Breakdown
 1. React Application Setup
 The application was built using Create React App (CRA), and all core functionalities have been implemented as per the requirements. Firebase is used for authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their blog posts securely.

2. Homepage and Blog List
The homepage displays a list of blog posts. Each blog card shows the blog title, description (previewed), and cover image. Users can edit or delete their blog posts from this list.

3. Single Blog Page
A separate page is created to view the full blog post. The user can click on any blog card to view the complete post, which includes the full description created via the ReactQuill text editor.

4. User Authentication with Firebase
Firebase Authentication is used for secure login and signup. Once logged in, users can view their blog posts, edit them, or delete them as necessary.

5. Add/Edit/Delete Blog Post
Users can create new blog posts by entering a title, description (using ReactQuill), and an image URL. The blog data is stored in Redux Toolkit, making it easy to update the applicationâ€™s state across all components.

6. Redux Toolkit for State Management
Redux Toolkit is used to manage the state of the blog posts. It helps in keeping track of the blog data, and ensures the application is scalable and maintainable.
